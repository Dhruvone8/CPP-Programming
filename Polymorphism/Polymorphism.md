## Polymorphism

* Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows a single interface (such as a function or operator) to take multiple forms. 
* It enables different objects to respond to the same function call in different ways, improving flexibility and reusability in a program. 
* 'Poly' means many morphism means 'forms'

### Polymorphism are of two types
```
1. Compile-Time Polymorphism

    * In Compile-Time Polymorphism, binding is done at Time of Compilation.
    * For e.g: There are two functions with same name, then which function is to be called is decided at Compile Time.
    * It can be achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
```
```
2. Run-Time Polymorphism
    * In Run-Time Polymorphism, binding is done at Run Time.
    * It is achieved by using Virtual Functions.
```
