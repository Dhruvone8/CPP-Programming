### Standard Template Library (STL) in C++

* STL (Standard Template Library) in C++ is a powerful collection of template-based classes and functions that provide common data structures and algorithms to make programming easier and more efficient.

#### Components of STL
```
1. Containers : Containers stores data

Types of Containers:
a. Sequence Containers (e.g: vector, list, dqueue)
b. Associative Containers
c. Unordered Associative Containers
d. Derived Containers
```
```
2. Algorithms: Used for Operations like Sorting, Searching etc.
```
```
3. Iterators: Used to traverse through containers and establishes a link between containers and algorithms
